# Istanbul Retail Performance Analysis (2021–2023)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes three years of retail transaction data from shopping malls in Istanbul to uncover key drivers of revenue, customer behavior patterns, and demographic trends.

Using Power BI, the analysis explores how customers shop across different malls, product categories, and payment methods. The goal is to generate actionable insights that can support strategic retail decision-making.

This project demonstrates skills in data analysis, business intelligence, and data visualization.
